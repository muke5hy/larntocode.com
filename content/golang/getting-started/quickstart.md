Flowbite is a library of components built on top of the utility-classes from Tailwind CSS and it also includes a JavaScript file that makes interactive elements works, such as modals, dropdowns, and more. Learn how to get started by following this quickstart guide.

## Require via NPM

Make sure that you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="nofollow">Tailwind CSS</a> installed.

1. Install Flowbite as a dependency using NPM by running the following command:

```bash
npm i flowbite
```

2. Require Flowbite as a plugin inside the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [require("flowbite/plugin")],
};
```

3. Include the main JavaScript file to make interactive elements work:

```html
<script src="../path/to/flowbite/dist/flowbite.js"></script>
```

4. Additionally to your own `content` data you should add `flowbite` to apply the classes from the interactive elements in the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ["./node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js"],
};
```

If you use Webpack or other bundlers you can also import it like this:

```javascript
import "flowbite";
```

## Include via CDN

The quickest way to get started working with FlowBite is to simply include the CSS and JavaScript into your project via CDN.

Require the following minified stylesheet inside the `head` tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/flowbite@{{< current_version >}}/dist/flowbite.min.css" />
```

And include the following JavaScript file before the end of the `body` element:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/flowbite@{{< current_version >}}/dist/flowbite.js"></script>
```

## Tailwind CSS 2.0

Flowbite works with the 2.x version of Tailwind CSS.

## Tailwind CSS 3.0

Feel free to upgrade to version 3 of Tailwind CSS as there are no breaking changes when using the components from Flowbite.
